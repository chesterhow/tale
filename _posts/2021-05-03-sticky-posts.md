## Making a post "sticky"

Add `sticky: true` to the frontmatter of your blog post.

### Exclude sticky post from paginated posts

By default, sticky posts are still included in the paginated posts. To exclude a sticky post from paginated posts, add `hidden: true` to the frontmatter of that blog post.

## Example

See the ["Introducing Tale" post](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale/blob/master/_posts/2017-03-29-introducing-tale.md).

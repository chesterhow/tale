For the past 2 months, we've been attempting to solve a `simple` but rather `interesting` problem at work.
I call it `simple` because at first glance, it looks like an everyday task that has been solved by so many people on kaggle (you can find kaggle based solutions [here](https://github.com/owenzhang/kaggle-avazu), [here](https://williamqliu.github.io/2015/06/07/kaggle-avazu-adclick.html) and [here](http://lenguyenthedat.com/minimal-data-science-2-avazu/)) and `interesting` because we had to iterate through so many approaches before getting to a solution we felt solves most of this problem.

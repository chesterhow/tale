Hi, my name is Ram! I am a freshman at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram.
I am majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning.

As William Glasser puts it -

> ...We learn 95% of what we teach to someone else.

Therefore, through this blog, I want to explain some concepts of Machine Learning to my readers.
This is because I have been told many times that Computer Science is clerical work, devoid of any true
thinking. With respect to this appalling sense, I want my readers to see just how sophisticated and fun
the world of Computer Science can be!

Hyoyoung Kim is a designer with a background in digital experiences and brand identities. She conveys big ideas and creates subjects/projects/objects for a varied list of clients, ranging from multinationals to start-ups. She applies conceptual thinking, strategic focus, meticulous craftsmanship and superfluous witty throughout the every stage of her design process. More than this, she works closely with her clients to provide an opportunity for clear communication.

She holds MA in Brand Management from Hongik Graduate School of Advertising and Public Relations and a BFA in Visual Communication Design from Hongik University. She works full time in Toss in Seoul, South Korea. She is also the founder of Romantic Studio, a small satellite design studio with a strong focus on digital and graphic design. Her work has been awarded at Red Dot 2014.

Outside of the office, she keeps busy with playing tennis and ping-pong, doing some gardening and exploring a pretty and calm place. She currently lives in Seoul with her awesome cats.


While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which works really well with GitHub Pages. I figured it would do just fine for my friend and I set about searching for a pretty theme. I wanted a theme with a _book-ish_ vibe. Unfortunately, most of the themes were too modern. Eventually, I caved and begun working on my own theme. With the help of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll Butler, I was able to build **Tale**.

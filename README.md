## Installation

There are 3 ways to install this theme

1. Install it as a Ruby Gem (for self-hosted sites)
2. Install it with the `jekyll-remote-theme` plugin (for GitHub Pages hosted sites)
3. Fork the project directly

### Ruby Gem method



1. Add this line to your `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    gem "tale"
    ```

2. Install the theme's gems and dependencies:

    ```bash
    $ bundle
    ```

3. In `_config.yml` add these lines:

    ```yaml
    theme:      tale

    permalink:  /:year-:month-:day/:title
    paginate:   5
    ```

    Remove any other `theme:` lines.

4. Rename `index.md` to `index.html`. Without this, the `jekyll-paginate` gem will not work.

5. In `about.md`, change the `layout:` field to `post`:

    ```Markdown
    layout: post
    ```

### GitHub Pages method

1. Add these 2 lines in to your `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
    gem "jekyll-paginate"
    ```

2. Install the newly added gems:

    ```bash
    $ bundle
    ...
    ```

3. In `_config.yml` add these lines:

    ```yaml
    remote_theme: chesterhow/tale

    permalink:    /:year-:month-:day/:title
    paginate:     5

    plugins:
      - jekyll-paginate
      - jekyll-remote-theme
    ```

    Remove any other `theme:` or `remote_theme:` lines.

4. Rename `index.md` to `index.html`. Without this, the `jekyll-paginate` gem will not work.

5. In `about.md`, change the `layout:` field to `post`:

    ```Markdown
    layout: post
    ```

### Fork method

1. Fork this repository

2. Delete the unnecessary files/folders: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `tale.gemspec`

3. Delete the `baseurl` line in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
baseurl:  "/tale"   # delete this line
```

## Usage

Once you've installed the theme, you're ready to work on your Jekyll site. To start off, I would recommend updating `_config.yml` with your site's details.

To build and serve your site, run:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
...
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

And you're all set! Head over to <http://127.0.0.1:4000/> to see your site in action.

### Enabling Comments

Comments are disabled by default. To enable them, look for the following line in `_config.yml` and change `jekyll-tale` to your site's Disqus id.

```yml
disqus: jekyll-tale
```

Next, add `comments: true` to the YAML front matter of the posts which you would like to enable comments for.

To enable globally, add `comments: true` to  `_config.yml`

### Enabling RTL

To enable RTL support, add `RTL: true` to `_config.yml`

Hi, I am _@huxpro_ (Huang, Xuan), a will-be [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) software engineer and a professed digital designer. My interests range from programming languages in general (type system, type-based formal verification, compiler construction, runtime system) to indurstial software engineering (web/mobile app development, user interface and UX, developer infra and DX). 

In the past, I worked on [Alitrip (Fliggy)](https://www.alitrip.com/) mobile and web apps under the [Alibaba Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group), found and lead front-end infrastructure team at a unicorn startup [Beijing Weiying (WePiao)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beijing-weiying-technology), and helped [Ele.me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ele.me) to upgrade their mobile web into [the first influential PWA (progressive web app) in China](https://medium.com/elemefe/upgrading-ele-me-to-progressive-web-app-2a446832e509).

I studied BA, Digital Media Art at [Communication University of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_University_of_China) and MS, Computer Science at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology), with a focus on programming languages theory and construction.


##### My Programming Languages Spectrum

I generally prefer languages that are close to ML ("Meta Language"), i.e. _mostly functional programming_. This should explain most of my picks e.g. JavaScript within dynamically-typed's, Scala within JVM's, Rust within unmanaged's.
